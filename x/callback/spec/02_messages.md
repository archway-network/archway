# Messages

Section describes the processing of the module messages

## MsgUpdateParams

The module params can be updated via a governance proposal using the x/gov module. The proposal needs to include [MsgUpdateParams](../../../proto/archway/callback/v1/tx.proto#L25) message. All the parameters need to be provided when creating the msg.

On success: 
* Module `Params` are updated to the new values

This message is expected to fail if:
* The msg is sent by someone who is not the x/gov module
* The param values are invalid

## MsgRequestCallback

A new callback can be registered by using the [MsgRequestCallback](../../../proto/archway/callback/v1/tx.proto#L39) message.

On success:
