# CWErrors

This module is the error handling mechanism for the protocol to let the contract know of errors encountered

## Concepts

[callback](../../callback/spec/README.md) module and [cwica](../../cwica/spec/README.md) module both rely on protocol invoking contract execution. In case, there are any errors generated by the protocol, there needs to be a way to let the contract know of this error. The module provides a standard way of error catching from the contract side.

The module provides two diffferent ways that the error is communicated.

### 1. Errors saved in state (default)

Whenever a contract relevant error is encountered by the protocol, the module stores the error and associates with the contract address. This is stored in the chain state for `x` number of blocks (The `x` value is a module parameter. [See more](./01_state.md)) after which the error is permanently deleted. These stored errors are queryable by the contract using stargate queries.

### 2. Errors sudo callback

If a contract is subscribed to errors, then the contract will be invoked at the sudo entrypoint like so.

```rust
#[cw_serde]
pub enum SudoMsg  {
    Error {
        module_name: String, // The name of the module which generated the error
        error_code: u32, // module specific error code
        contract_address: String, // the contract address which is associated with the error; the contract receiving the callback
        input_payload: String, // any relevant input payload which caused the error
        error_message: String, // the relevant error message
    }
}
```

The subscriptions are an opt-in feature where the contractadmin/owner has to subscribe to the feature by paying the relevant fees. [See more](01_state.md) The subscription is valid for `x` number of blocks where `x` is decided by the module param. The subscription cannot be cancelled but can be extended by attempting to subscribe again.
