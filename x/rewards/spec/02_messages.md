# Messages

Section describes the processing of the module messages.

## MsgSetContractMetadata

A contract metadata is created / updated using the [MsgSetContractMetadata](../../../proto/archway/rewards/v1/tx.proto#L22) message.

On success:

- Metadata's `owner_address` / `rewards_address` is set / updated;

This message is expected to fail if:

* A corresponding contract is not found (not *Instantiated*);
* Metadata does not exist: the message sender is not the contract admin (CowmWasm *Instantiate* option);
* Metadata exists: the message sender is not the `owner_address` (metadata field);

Metadata can also be updated by a contract ([WASM bindings section](08_wasm_bindings.md)).

## MsgWithdrawRewards

Contract(s) rewards are withdrawn using the [MsgWithdrawRewards](../../../proto/archway/rewards/v1/tx.proto#L36) message.
This operation fetches a specific amount of `RewardsRecord` objects created for a particular `rewards_address`, transfers tracked tokens and prunes those objects.
There are two operation modes (one of) for this message:

* `RecordsLimit` - a user defines the maximum number of records to be processed;
* `RecordIDs` - a user defines a list of `RewardsRecord` IDs to be processed;

On success:

* Rewards address receives rewards tokens;
* Processed `RewardsRecord` objects are pruned;

This message is expected to fail if:

* Specified number of records for processing (by limit / by IDs) exceeds the `MaxWithdrawRecords` module parameter;
* Provided record ID is not found;
* Provided record ID is not linked to the message sender (`rewards_address`);

Returns:

* The message [response](../../../proto/archway/rewards/v1/tx.proto#L59) contains the total amount of rewards tokens transferred (empty if this rewards address has no rewards yet);

This *withdrawal* operation can also be triggered by a contract ([WASM bindings section](08_wasm_bindings.md)).

## MsgSetFlatFee

A contract flat fee is created / updated / deleted using the [MsgSetFlatFee](../../../proto/archway/rewards/v1/tx.proto#L74) message.

An empty or zero _flat_fee_ removes the fee for the contract if it already exists.

On success:

- Contract's `flat_fee` is set / updated / removed;

This message is expected to fail if:

* ContractMetadata does not exist;
* Metadata exists: the message sender is not the `owner_address` (metadata field);
