## CLI

### Query

The `query` commands allows a user to query the module state.

Use the `-h` / `--help` flag to get a help description of a command.

```bash
archwayd q rewards -h

> You can add the `-o json` for the JSON output format.

#### params

```bash
archwayd q rewards params [flags]
```

Example output:

```yaml

### Transactions

The `tx` commands allows a user to interact with the module.

Use the `-h` / `--help` flag to get a help description of a command.

```bash
archwayd tx rewards -h
```

#### set-contract-metadata

Create / update a contract metadata state. Operation is authorized to:

* Creating metadata: contract admin (set via CosmWasm *Instantiate* operation);
* Updating metadata: metadata's `owner_address`;

Usage:

```bash
archwayd tx rewards set-contract-metadata [contract-address] [flags]
```

Command specific flags:

* `--owner-address` - update the contract owner address;
* `--rewards-address` - update the contract rewards receiver address;

Example (delegate rewards ownership to the contract):

```bash
archwayd tx rewards set-contract-metadata archway14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9sy85n2u \
  --owner-address archway14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9sy85n2u \
  --rewards-address archway14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9sy85n2u \
  --from myAccountKey
  --fees 1500uarch
```

#### withdraw-rewards

Withdraw the current credited dApp rewards to a sender account.
This transaction uses `RewardsRecord` objects that are created for a specific `rewards_address` during the dApp rewards distribution.
A `RewardsRecord` entry contains a portion of credited rewards by a specific contract at a block height.
The `withdraw-rewards` command has two operation modes, which defines which `RewardsRecord` objects to process:

* *Records by limit* - select the first N `RewardsRecord` objects available;
* *Records by IDs* - select specific `RewardsRecord` objects by their IDs;

Usage:

```bash
archwayd tx rewards withdraw-rewards [flags]
```

Command specific flags:

* `--records-limit` - the maximum number of `RewardsRecord` objects to process;
* `--record-ids` - the list of `RewardsRecord` object IDs to process;

> `records-limit` value / `record-ids` length must be equal or less than the `MaxWithdrawRecords` parameter value.
> 
> One of (`records-limit`, `record-ids`) modes must be provided.

Example:

```bash
carcarchwaydh1_tx rewards withdraw-rewards \
  --records-limit 1000 \
  --from myAccountKey \
  --fees 3000uarch
```
