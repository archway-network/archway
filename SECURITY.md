# Archway Security Policy

This document describes the Archway Security team's process for handling security issues.

## Reporting Security Issues

__IMPORTANT:__ _Please DO NOT open public issues for security related matters, or discuss it in public forum or on social media._

### Email

All security issues should be reported via email to [security@philabs.xyz](mailto:security@philabs.xyz). Email is delivered to the Archway Security team at Phi Labs.

Include the following details in the report:

- Your name;
- Your affiliation (if applicable);
- Technical description of the issue, including steps to reproduce;
- Explanation of who may be able to exploit this vulnerability and what the impact or implications may be;
- Whether this vulnerability is public or known to third parties. Please provide details where applicable;

_Please notify the Archway Security team at the email above of existing public issues that may be of critical security importance._ Please ensure to include the issue ID along with a short description / explanation of the security relevance.

### GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting

Under the repository "Security" tab / Security Advisories you will find "Report a vulnerability". Please complete the provided form with as much details as possible.

For more information on GitHub private vulnerability reporting [see this](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

_Best practices for writing repository security advisories_ can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/best-practices-for-writing-repository-security-advisories).

Security researchers can also use the REST API to privately report security vulnerabilities. For more information, see "[Privately report a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/security-advisories/repository-advisories#privately-report-a-security-vulnerability)" in the REST API documentation.

## Handling Security Issues

The Archway Security team will:

1. Verify and confirm the issue;
2. Determine affected versions and scope of impact;
3. Conduct audits to find any potential similar and related issues;
4. Prepare fixes for relevant in-production releases;
5. Endeavor to communicate and coordinate with relevant ecosystem stakeholders, including the Archway communities, at the appropriate times;

Please assist the Archway Security team by following these guidelines:

- Allow a reasonable amount of time for the team to respond to and address the issue;
- Avoid exploiting any issues or vulnerabilities that you may become aware of;
- Demonstrate good faith by not disrupting the Archway's networks, data, services or communities;

_Every effort will be made to handle and address security issues as quickly and efficiently as possible._
