The core implementation of the Archway protocol leverages the [Cosmos SDK](https://cosmos.network) and [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com) to reward validators and creators for their contributions to the network.

## System Requirements

The following specifications have been found to work well:

- An x86-64 (amd64) multi-core CPU (AMD / Intel);
  - Higher clock speeds are preferred as Tendermint is mostly single-threaded;
- 64GB RAM;
- 1TB NVMe SSD Storage (disk i/o is crucial);
- 100Mbps bi-directional Internet connection;

## Software Dependencies

The following software should be installed on the target system:

- The Go Programming Language (<https://go.dev>)
- Git Distributed Version Control (<https://git-scm.com>)
- Docker (<https://www.docker.com>)
- GNU Make (<https://www.gnu.org/software/make>)

## Build from Source

[Clone the repository](https://github.com/archway-network/archway), checkout the `main` branch and build:

```sh
cd archway
git checkout main
make install
```

This will install the `archwayd` binary to your `GOPATH`.

## Dockerized Containers

A docker image for production purposes (no shell access):

[Packages: archwayd](https://github.com/orgs/archway-network/packages/container/package/archwayd)

A docker image is also provided for test setups (shell access):

[Packages: archwayd-debug](https://github.com/orgs/archway-network/packages/container/package/archwayd-dev)

## Running localnet

There are two ways to run a localnet, local and containerized

### Containerized

This solution uses docker-compose and docker on the backend.
To setup new localnet use:

```
make localnet
```

To continue last localnet used:

```
make localnet-continue
```

### Local
